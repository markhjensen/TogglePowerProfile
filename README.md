# TogglePowerProfile
PowerShell and vbs to toggle Power Profiles

I use this script with WinHotKey to toggle between Power Saving and Balanced power plans.


How to setup in WinHotKey:
Install WinHotKey
New Hotkey
Browse to wrapper.vbs
press advanced
Input the path to the ps1 scrip in the "prove paramters" section, no quotes required
Input the script folder for wrapper.vbs in the "start in folder"
Press OK

Note that wrapper.vbs is not required, I jsut it to avoid seeing the powershell terminal popup
